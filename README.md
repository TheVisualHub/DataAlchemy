How Nature encodes information with such incredible fidelity has long been among the central mysteries of molecular biology. Despite its immense capacity, the molecule of life is compacted into the microscopic confines of the nucleus. And within this tiny universe lies the genetic blueprint. DNA naturally exhibits remarkable robustness, preserving the integrity of genetic information throughout countless generations. Such natural resilience inspires modern IT innovations designed to ensure data integrity against hardware failures, cyber attacks, and environmental threats.
